# üîí Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices for using the Fullstack Authentication Template.

## üö® Important Security Notes

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit real environment variables** to version control
- **Always use `.env.local`** for your actual configuration
- **The `.gitignore` file** is configured to exclude all environment files
- **Use `env.example`** as a template for your configuration

### Production Deployment
- **Generate strong secrets** for production environments
- **Use environment-specific configurations**
- **Enable HTTPS** in production
- **Regularly update dependencies**

## üîê Security Features Included

### Authentication Security
- **Bcrypt password hashing** with configurable rounds
- **JWT token management** with short expiration times
- **Session security** with NextAuth.js
- **Account locking** after failed login attempts
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints

### File Upload Security
- **File type validation** - Only allowed file types
- **File size limits** - Configurable maximum sizes
- **Unique filename generation** - Prevents conflicts
- **User ownership verification** - Users can only access their files
- **Admin oversight** - Admins can manage all files

### Database Security
- **Prisma ORM** - Prevents SQL injection
- **Parameterized queries** - All database operations are safe
- **Input validation** - Zod schemas validate all inputs
- **Role-based access control** - Proper permission checks

### API Security
- **CORS protection** - Configured for security
- **Input sanitization** - All inputs are validated
- **Error handling** - No sensitive information in error messages
- **Activity logging** - Complete audit trail

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Generate strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- [ ] Configure production database with strong credentials
- [ ] Set up HTTPS certificates
- [ ] Configure Firebase with proper security rules
- [ ] Set up Google OAuth with correct redirect URIs
- [ ] Configure email service for verification
- [ ] Set appropriate file upload limits
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for your use case

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Review access logs regularly
- [ ] Backup database regularly
- [ ] Test security features periodically

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Security
```bash
# Generate strong secrets
openssl rand -base64 32  # For NEXTAUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32  # For JWT_SECRET
```

### Firebase Security Rules
The template includes basic Firebase security rules. Review and customize:
- `firestore.rules` - Database access rules
- `storage.rules` - File storage rules

### Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Limit database access to application only
- Enable SSL connections in production
- Regular backups with encryption

## üö® Security Vulnerabilities

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in this template:

1. **Do not create a public issue**
2. **Email security details** to the maintainer
3. **Include steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
4. **Provide any relevant code** or configuration

### Common Security Mistakes to Avoid
- Using default passwords
- Committing environment files
- Not updating dependencies
- Disabling HTTPS in production
- Using weak secrets
- Not validating file uploads
- Exposing sensitive information in error messages

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Authentication attempts
- File upload activities
- Admin actions
- Error logs
- Rate limiting violations

### Tools for Security Monitoring
- Application logs
- Database access logs
- File system access logs
- Network traffic monitoring
- Security scanning tools

### Security Testing
- Run security audits: `npm audit`
- Test authentication flows
- Validate file upload security
- Check for common vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing (recommended for production)
